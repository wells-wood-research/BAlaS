        <h3>ALAscanApp.py</h3>

        <p>
          This is a python 3 utility to do alanine scanning using ISAMBARD and BUDE.
          It is a self-contained utility. It does not need installation. 
          However, it needs to have Python 3.5 or greater. 
          It also needs a reasonably recent C++ compiler.  We recommend GCC.
        </p>

        <p>
          This utility is meant to work in Linux and Mac systems.
          This document explains how 
          to get it working in these systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the App to work it is required to compile BUDE, the 
          C++ utilities and update/create the App initialisation file
          &lpar;.alascanapp.ini&rpar;. Hopefully all of that was/will 
          be done with the <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span> script.
        </p>

        <p>
          If using a different compiler from GCC or Mac system, exporting 
          the CC and CXX environment variables should be done before 
          attempting any compilation procedure or running the 
          <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span>.
          To use <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span> python 3
          must be available.
        </p>

        <h3>Definitions for Running Commands</h3>

        <p>
          PATH: Environment variable containing information on where to look for executable.
          <br />
          HOME: Environment variable containing the information of the
          user&apos;s home directory.
          <br />
          username: User&apos;s name in the system. e.g. ai7766
          <br />
          &lsquo;<kbd>&gt;</kbd>&rsquo; means prompt from a terminal as ordinary user.
          <br />
          &lsquo;<kbd>&num;</kbd>&rsquo; means prompt from a terminal as root or admin user.
          <br />
          &lsquo;<kbd>&gt;&gt;&gt;</kbd>&rsquo; means prompt for python interpreter.
        </p>

        <p>
          HOME usually is expanded to
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">/home/username</span>&rsquo;
          in Mac systems
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">/Users/username</span>&rsquo;.
        </p>

        <p>
          e.g.
          <br />
          <kbd>&gt;ls dir</kbd>
          <br />
          List content of dir as ordinary user
          <br />
          <br />
          <kbd>&num;zypper install package</kbd>
          <br />
          Install package as root user.
          <br />
          <br />
          <kbd>&gt;&gt;&gt;quit&lpar;&rpar;</kbd>
          <br />
          Quit python interpreter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Italics show a command and its output.

          <br />
          <kbd>&gt;command
            <br />
            command output</kbd>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Requirements:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            GCC 4.6 or modern C++ compiler.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python 3.5 or greater &lpar;Anaconda&rpar;.
          </li>
          <li>
            ISAMBARD
          </li>
          <li>
            BUDE
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Linux</h3>

        <p>
          Most Linux systems have GCC available. Checking if you
          have GCC, using the command
          &lsquo;which&rsquo;.
        </p>

        <p>
          <kbd>&gt;which gcc</kbd>
          
          <br />
          
          <code>
            /usr/bin/gcc
          </code>
          
          &lpar;Or similar, depending on where gcc is installed&rpar;.
          <br />
          <br />
          
          <kbd>&gt;which g++</kbd>
          
          <br />
          
          <code>
            /usr/bin/g++
          </code>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          If it is not available it should display something along these lines:
          <br />
          <code>
            which: no g++ in PATH
          </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          If it is not installed in your computer you will need admin rights to install it.
          Depending on your Linux distribution.
        </p>

        <p>
          SuSE family
          <br />
          <kbd>&num;zypper install gcc</kbd>
        </p>

        <p>
          Red Hat family
          <br />
          <kbd>&num;yum install gcc</kbd>
        </p>

        <p>
          Debian family
          <br />
          <kbd>&gt;sudo apt-get install gcc</kbd>
        </p>

        <p>
          Once GCC is installed you can check with
          &lsquo;which&rsquo; command again and it should
          give you the full path where g++, gcc was installed.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have a different compiler, type at the terminal.
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;export CC=my_C_Compiler CXX=my_C++_Compiler</kbd>

        <h3>Getting python anaconda</h3>

        <p>
          Go to website: 
          <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a>:
          <br />
          Download the appropriate installer for python 3.X, most likely it will be
          &lpar;64-BIT &lpar;X86&rpar; INSTALLER&rpar;, it should download the file
          <span class="cmds">Anaconda3-X.X.X-Linux-x86_64.sh</span>
          where &lpar;X.X.X&rpar; is the version.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open a terminal and change directory to wherever the installer was downloaded,
          run the command and follow the instructions.
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt; bash Anaconda3-X.X.X-Linux-x86_64.sh</kbd>

        <p>
          accept the license, press enter and the letter
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">q</span>&rsquo;,
          type &lsquo;<span class="emph">yes</span>&rsquo; after the question:
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>
            Do you approve the license terms&quest; [yes|no]
          </code>
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          After this you will be asked the location for installing Anaconda3.
          It suggests
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>
            /home/username/anaconda3
          </code>
          <br />
          <br />
          You must have writing access to this location. The default value usually
          is a good place. If you wish a different location type it.
        </p>

        <p>
          It will output:
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>
            PREFIX=/home/username/anaconda3
          </code>
          <br />
          <br />
          and the installation begins.
        </p>

        <p>
        All going well you should see this message
        </p>
        
        <code>
          Python 3.6.1 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.
          <br />
          creating default environment...
          <br />
          installation finished.
          <br />
          Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda3 install location
          <br />
          to PATH in your /home/username/.bashrc &quest; [yes|no]
          <br />
          [no] &gt;&gt;&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          Answer &lsquo;<span class="emph">yes</span>&rsquo; to that final
          question. This will allow you to use
          that python version whenever you open a terminal.
          All done with anaconda.
        </p>

        <p>
          Close that terminal and open a new one. This will ensure that
          you are using the right version of python. To check it use the
          &lsquo;which&rsquo; command.
        </p>

        <p>
          <kbd>&gt;which python
            <br />
            /home/username/anaconda3/bin/python</kbd> &lpar;or wherever you installed it&rpar;
        </p>

        <p>
          Checking python version:
        </p>

        <p>
          <kbd>&gt;python --version
            <br />
            Python 3.6.X :: Anaconda X.X.X &lpar;64-bit&rpar;</kbd> &lpar;
          according to the downloaded version&rpar;
        </p>

        <p>
          Please check that the version is <span class="emph">greater than 3.5</span>.
        </p>

        <h3>Installing ISAMBARD</h3>

        <kbd>&gt;pip install isambard</kbd>

        <p>
          This should install all required packages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have a look at this page for more information.
          <br />
          <a href="https://github.com/woolfson-group/isambard/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/woolfson-group/isambard/blob/master/README.md</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          We will need <span class="emph">Scwrl4</span>
          for creating the mutants for the hot constellations. 
          If Scwrl4 is not present only the single alanine 
          mutants will be calculated without any sidechain repacking.
        </p>

        <h3>Configuring ISAMBARD</h3>

        <p>
          We need to run the python interpreter and import isambard
        </p>

        <p>
          <kbd>&gt;python</kbd>
          <br />
          <br />
          It will show the message below and will open a python
          prompt &lsquo;&gt;&gt;&gt;&rsquo;
          <br />
          <br />
          <kbd>Python 3.6.X :: Anaconda X.X.X &lpar;64-bit&rpar;
            <br />
            ...
            &gt;&gt;&gt;
          </kbd>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Once you have the python prompt type:
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;&gt;&gt;import isambard</kbd>

        <p>
          This will start isambard configuration. It will ask a few questions. 
          For hot constellations we are interested in the Scwrl4 path. 
          You should be able to see the following information. 
          Bold text is meant to be input by the user. 
          We are particularly interested in the SCWRL path, Rigid packing mode 
          and Bude_2016v1 force field. 
          If some of the executables are not present, 
          pressing &lsquo;Enter&rsquo; should suffice.
        </p>

        <h3>C++ Utilities</h3>

        <p>
          I am assuming that you have the
          <span class="cmpress">alaScanApp-dist.tar.gz</span>
          file and it was unpacked and uncompressed creating a directory
          <span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>
          in your home directory with the following structure.
        </p>

        <code>
          /HOME/<span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>
          <br />
          /HOME/<span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>/<span class="cmpress">alaScanApp.tar.gz</span>
          <br />
          /HOME/<span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>/<span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span>
          <br />
          /HOME/<span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>/<span class="dir">ccpCode</span>
          <br />
          /HOME/<span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>/<span class="dir">ccpCode</span>/<span class="dir">getSD</span>

          <br />
          /HOME/<span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>/<span class="dir">ccpCode</span>/<span class="dir">dividePDB</span>

          <br />
          /HOME/<span class="dir">alaScanApp-dist</span>/<span class="dir">doc</span>
        </code>

        <p>
          We change into that directory from HOME.
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;cd alaScanApp-dist</kbd>

        <p>
          We should run the <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span>
          script. It will display information and waits for user input at
          three stages. Typing &lsquo;<span class="emph">yes</span>&rsquo; or pressing enter will be understood as
          &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and the script will continue.
          Typing &lsquo;<span class="emph">no</span>&rsquo; will avoid that step.
          Typing anything else will enter a loop until any of
          those three options is typed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <kbd>&gt;./setup_utils.py</kbd>
          <br />

          <kbd> ...
            <br />
            Loads of information,
            <br />
            Do you want to continue [yes|no]&quest; [yes]
            <br />
            Loads of information,
            <br />
            ... </kbd>

        </p>

        <p>
          Please be patient, it might take a few minutes. 
          Hopefully, all C++ programs were compiled with 
          <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span>. If that was not
          the case this is how to do them.
        </p>

        <h3>BUDE</h3>

        <p>
          We need to unpack and uncompress bude
          &lpar;<span class="cmpress">BUDE-1.2.9.tar.gz</span>&rpar;.
          There is no need to install it but we will need to compile it.
          If we have installed a modern version of GCC it should be painless.
          The compress file should be within the
          <span class="dir">cppCode</span> directory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Change to the C++ directory.
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;cd cppCode</kbd>

        <p>
          Extract and decompress BUDE
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;tar -xzvf BUDE-1.2.9.tar.gz</kbd>

        <p>
          This should create a directory called
          <span class="dir">BUDE-1.2.9</span>.
          Let’s change into that directory, make a build directory 
          and change into it by executing the commands below.
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;cd BUDE-1.2.9
          <br />
          &gt;mkdir build
          <br />
          &gt;cd build</kbd>

        <p>
          Once we are in the build directory, we compile BUDE.
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;../configure --prefix=$HOME</kbd>

        <p>
          A few messages will appear:
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>
            checking ...
            <br />
            ...
          </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          After the <span class="cmds">../configure</span> script is finished we type the command
        </p>

        <p>
          <kbd>&gt;make</kbd>
        </p>

        <p>
          Please be patient, the make command produces a healthy amount of
          output and it will take a few minutes depending on the speed of your
          machine. All going well there will be a directory called 
          &lsquo;<span class="dir">bin</span>&rsquo; with a few <span class="emph">bude_xxx</span>
          utilities and one called <span class="emph">budeScan</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To check that all went well type
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;bin/budeScan -h</kbd>

        <p>
          And the BUDE help should be displayed.
          If we want to install BUDE in the home directory type
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;make install</kbd>

        <p>
          This will install all bude applications in
          /<span class="dir">HOME</span>/<span class="dir">bin</span>
          and libraries in
          /<span class="dir">HOME</span>/<span class="dir">lib&lpar;64&rpar;</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do not want to install it take note of the path where the executable is.
          It will be needed for the ALAscanApp configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we should compile the C++ utilities. They are in the
          <span class="dir">cppCode</span> directory.
          If we are doing it after compiling BUDE. Change to the
          <span class="dir">cppCode</span> directory.
        </p>
        <kbd>&gt;cd ../../</kbd>

        <p>
          Once you are in the cppCode directory we use the
          <span class="cmds">comp_utils.sh</span>
          script to compile all C++ utilities. Type:
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;./comp_utils.sh</kbd>
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>
          Compiling getSD
          <br />
          ...
          <br />
          Compiling colourBySD
          <br />
          ...
          <br />
          Compiling dividePDB
        </code>
        <p>
          That should be all about compilation.
        </p>

        <h3>Initialization file</h3>

        <p>
          The initialisation file
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">.alascanapp.ini</span>&rsquo;
          will be created or
          updated in the user&apos;s home directory when running
          <span class="cmds">ALAscanApp.py</span> or <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span>.
          The file will be created by either script, if it does not exist.
          <span class="cmds">ALAscanApp.py</span>
          will update the file only if any section or option is missing.
          <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span> will always update the
          relevant sections of the compiled utilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          The file is composed by sections,  defined by square brackets
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">&lsqb;Section&rsqb;</span>&rsquo;. 
           Each section may have several options and their values, 
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">AnOption &equals; a_value</span>&rsquo;.
        </p>
       <p>
          This file could be edited to alter the ALAscanApp behaviour. 
          Only the values can be modified. 
          Options the values of which contain curly brackets preceded by the sign
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">&dollar;</span>&rsquo;
          should not be modified. eg.
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">AnOptionX &equals; &dollar;&lcub;doNoModify&rcub;</span>&rsquo;.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sections have self-explanatory names. There are some options
          that must be updated if the
          <span class="cmds">setup_utils.py</span>
          script was not run.
        </p>

        <p>
          In section 
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">&lsqb;Directories&rsqb;</span>&rsquo;,
          option 
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">CppCode</span>&rsquo;,
          its value should be updated to its proper location.
          If executables budeScan, getSD and colourBySD are not within that
          directory then options
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">BUDE</span>&rsquo;,
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">GetSD</span>&rsquo;,
          and
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">ColourBySD</span>&rsquo;
          must also be updated accordingly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Alternatively, in section
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">&lsqb;Executables&rsqb;</span>&rsquo;
          the options
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">BUDE</span>&rsquo;,
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">GetSD</span>&rsquo;,
          and
          &lsquo;<span class="emph">ColourBySD</span>&rsquo; 
          could be updated with 
          the full path to these executables.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Behaviour Options</h3>
        
        <p>
          Any option&apos;s value within the section 
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">&lsqb;File Names&rsqb;</span>&rsquo;
          can be modified. They will change the naming of those particular files.
         </p> 
         
         <p>
           In section 
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">&lsqb;Directories&rsqb;</span>&rsquo; the
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">Work</span>&rsquo; 
           option should be changed to the directory where the 
           Hot Constellations will be created
           and <span class="cmds">ALAscanApp.py</span>
           will be run from, by default it will be 
           &lsquo;/HOME/<span class="dir">ALAscanApp</span>&rsquo;.
           Directories from the options 
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">Scan</span>&rsquo;,
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">BudeLibs</span>&rsquo;,
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">BudeResults</span>&rsquo;,
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">PdbSources</span>&rsquo;,
           and
           &lsquo;<span class="emph">Chimera</span>&rsquo;
           will be created within the work directory. 
           Their values could be modified.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To specify the maximum number of hot constellations that will be 
            calculated in the  auto mode, the option 
            &lsquo;<span class="emph">MaxAutoNumber</span>&rsquo;   
            in section 
            &lsquo;<span class="emph">&lsqb;General&rsqb;</span>&rsquo;
            can be modified. Very large numbers must be avoided.
           </p>
        
        <h3>Mac</h3>

        <p>
          The procedure is practically the same. The only difference is 
          that we will need to install a proper GCC, the one 
          that comes with Xcode is not a recent one.
        </p>

        <p>
          To install GCC we will need Xcode and, Homebrew. If they are not installed
          already we will need to install them first.
          <span class="emph">For installing these programs we will need admin rights</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open terminal. In finder&apos;s menu go &rArr; Utilities find the Terminal icon.
        </p>

        <h3>Xcode:</h3>

        <kbd>&gt;xcode-select --install</kbd>

        <p>
          Follow the instructions on the screen. Please be aware that there are several
          Web tutorials on how to install Xcode in the different flavours of Mac.
          A simple search &lsquo;install Xcode Mac&rsquo; will return
          very comprehensive tutorials.
        </p>

        <h3>Homebrew:</h3>

        <p>
          Please follow the installation instructions in the Homebrew&apos;s Website.
          <br />
          <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Installation.md"> https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Installation.md </a>
        </p>

        <h3>GCC:</h3>

        <p>
          Once we have Xcode and Homebrew we can install GCC.
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;brew install gcc
          <br />
          ... </kbd>

        <p>
          This will install GCC, there should be
          <span class="emph">gcc-X</span> and <span class="emph">g++-X</span> where <span class="emph">X</span> is the version
          of GCC.
        </p>

        <p>
          We need to set the CC and CXX variable
        </p>

        <kbd>&gt;export CC=gcc-X CXX=g++-X</kbd>

        <p>
          Exporting these variables must be done whenever we open a Terminal. 
          To avoid this it is recommended to add it into
          <span class="emph">.bash_profile</span> file, which is in your
          HOME directory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we follow the same procedure as described from the Linux 
          section for getting anaconda. Bear in mind that you will need the 
          Mac installer and you have two flavours, the command line and a 
          graphical one. The command line behaviour is pretty much like in 
          Linux. The graphical one has a very self-explanatory frontend.
